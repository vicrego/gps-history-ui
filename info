For content generation, 
-> First prompt for Chapter delineation:
Let's try to create some content. First, let's create a chapter list
delineation for {Name of the Building}. You'll research for the most accurate historical sources, but first let's organize the chapters the content will have. These chapters will be organized in a chronological way, from the beggning until the contemporaneous times, going through every major period of the building - it will have informative descriptions and various curiosities as you would see in a guided tour. 
Careful not to write just about architecture! I also need a lot of actually story
that happened on the given place.
But for now we only need to delineate the chapters for that. Please, don't forget to name the chapter.
Make sure to also list just the names of the chapter separately, so I can copy them easily.
Also, give me the chapters, but with this format:  { id: "12", title: "What It Means Today", content: [ { id: "", description: "" }, { id: "", description: "" }, ], }
Don't change what's within the content array!

-> Second prompt for Content:

Now let's make the actual content for the chapter which we've previously established as {name_of_the_chapter}. It must be very informative in terms of description of the building and history - filled with curiosities, as you would see in a guided tour. 
Careful not to write just about architecture. I also need a lot of actualy story
that happened on the given place.
Within the chapter you can write subtopics - for exemple: Chapter 2: Building the Cathedral. Subtopic 1: The first man to build the cathedral Subtopic 2: The logistical difficulties to build the cathedral etc...
Don't use bullet points. Please, put the number of the subchapter when 
you write the name of the subchapter. Please, also create an intro for the chapter.
Everytime you jump a line
use the symbol \n since this text will be used within a coding structure. 
I don't mean to use \n in between subchapter or at the end of the subchapter's text - avoid them -, I mean within the sub-chapters if needed.

GITHUB WORKFLOW

Summary Table
Step 	Action	    Why?
Push	git push    origin dev	     Uploads your code to the server so it can be merged.
Pull	git pull    origin main	     Syncs your local main with the new production code.
Sync	git merge   main (on dev)	 Keeps dev perfectly in line with main for the next feature.

-> UPDATE MAIN: 

* Switch to the main branch:
git checkout main

* Pull the latest main from GitHub: (Just in case there are changes there you don't have)
git pull origin main

* Merge dev into main:
git merge dev

* Push the updated main back to GitHub:
git push origin main

* Switch back to dev to keep working:
git checkout dev
