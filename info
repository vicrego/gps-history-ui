For content generation, 
-> Use first this prompt for Chapter delineation:
Let's try to create some content. First, let's create a chapter list
delineation for {Name of the Building}. You'll research for the most accurate historical sources, but first let's organize the chapters the content will have. These chapters will be organized in a chronological way, from the beggning until the contemporaneous times, going through every major period of the building - it will have informative descriptions and various curiosities as you would see in a guided tour. But for now we only need to deliniate the chapters for that. Please, don't forget to name the chapter.
Make sure to also list just the names of the chapter separately, so I can copy them easily.
Also, give me the chapters, but with this format:  { id: "12", title: "What It Means Today", content: [ { id: "", description: "" }, { id: "", description: "" }, ], }
Don't change what's within the content array!



-> Second prompt for pages:

FIRST PROMPT!!
Now let's make the actual content for each chapter. It must be very informative in terms of description of the building and history - filled with curiosities, as you would see in a guided tour. Within the chapter you can write subtopics - for exemple:
Chapter 1: Building the Cathedral.
Subtopic 1: The first man to build the cathedral
Subtopic 2: The logistical difficulties to build the cathedral
etc...
The chapter you will write is { Name of the chapter }.
Don't use bulletpoints. Please, put the number of the subchapter when 
you write the name of the subchapter.

REPETETIVE PROMPT!!!
Now let's make the actual content for the {number_of_the_chapter}, which we previously established as {name_of_the_chapter}. It must be very informative in terms of description of the building and history - filled with curiosities, as you would see in a guided tour. Within the chapter you can write subtopics - for exemple: Chapter 2: Building the Cathedral. Subtopic 1: The first man to build the cathedral Subtopic 2: The logistical difficulties to build the cathedral etc...
Don't use bulletpoints. Please, put the number of the subchapter when 
you write the name of the subchapter.
